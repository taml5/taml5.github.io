# 11. Container With Most Water

> You are given an integer array height of length $n$. There are $n$ vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the $i^{th}$ line are $(i, 0)$ and $(i, height[i])$.
> 
> Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
> 
> Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
> 
> Constraints:
>  - n == height.length
>  - 2 <= n <= 105
>  - 0 <= height[i] <= 104


```python
def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
	l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
	max_vol = 0
	
	while l < r:
		volume = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
		max_vol = max(max_vol, volume)
		if height[l] < height[r]:
			l += 1
		else:
			r -= 1
	
	return max_vol
```

## Time Complexity
Notice that `l` and `r` start at the ends of the array, and move towards each other one at a time. Since the while loop terminates when `l >= r`, the while loop iterates $n$ times. Each iteration is constant time, and since lines 1 and 2 as well as the return statement are constant time as well, the runtime complexity is in $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
## Space Complexity
The only space used is to store `l`, `r`, `max_vol`, and `volume`, which are all constant integers—thus the space complexity is constant, in $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

# 88. Merge Sorted Array

>You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
> 
>**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array_ `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.
>
>Constraints:
>- `nums1.length == m + n`
>- `nums2.length == n`
>- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
>- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
>- `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

Notice that `nums1` will take the form `nums1 = [A, 0]`, where `A` is `m` elements in the array (`nums1`), and `0` is `n` 0s in the array. Therefore, to merge the two lists in-place, we have to track where we can place the merged list and where `nums1` starts. To do so, we can merge from largest to smallest, keeping track of the biggest elements of `nums1` and `nums2` to insert next via their indices, and where the merged list begins.

```python
if len(nums2) == 0: return

# largest number in nums1 is at index m - 1
biggest1 = m - 1
biggest2 = n - 1
largest = m + n - 1

while biggest2 >= 0:
	# we need to check if biggest1 >= 0 in case that n > m, in which case
	# there is nothing to compare once we have inserted n - m elements-we
	# simply insert from nums2.
	# 
	# in the other case, if m > n, then since both lists are sorted, we can
	# simply exit the loop.
	if biggest1 >= 0 and nums1[biggest1] > nums2[biggest2]:
		nums1[largest] = nums1[biggest1]
		biggest1 -= 1
	else:
		nums1[largest] = nums2[biggest2]
		biggest2 -= 1
	
	largest -= 1
```

## Time Complexity
We iterate only through at most $\mathcal{O}(m + n)$ elements, we merge alternately. Since every step in the while loop is constant, and all assignment steps are also constant, the algorithm time complexity is in $\mathcal{O}(m + n)$.
## Space Complexity
Notice the only space we use is to store the variables `i, j, k`. Everything else is given with the input, so our space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
